What is JDBC?
    -JDBC stands for java databasr connectivity 
    -It is an API (application programming interface) in java
    -API is bridge which connect server to server
    -It allow java programs to connect and interact with databases (mysql, oracle, postgreesql etc)
    -JDBC provides a standard way to -established a connection between java and database
                                     -send sql queries
                                     - retrive and process the result 
                        
Why use JDBC?
    -It is platform indepented way to access databases
    -Easy to perform CRUD operation(create, read, update, delete)
    -It works with any related database using drivers
    -It forms the foudation of ORM tools like "Hibernate"

Components of JDBC
    1.DiverManagers- it manages all database drivers
    2.Drivers- it connect java apps to database
    3.Connection- it represents the database session
    4.Statement/ PreparedSatements/ CallableStatment - it is used to excecute sql queries
    5.ResultSet - it holds the result of executed queries

Types of JDBC drivers
    1. Type 1 JDBC ODBC Bridge - it used ODBC drivers
    2. Type 2 Native-API Drivers- - it uses native library of DB 
    3. Type 3 Network Protocol Driver - it uses middleware server 
    4. Type 4 Pure Java Driver -direct connection to DB (commonly used)
        type 4 driver (eg com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver)

Step to connect 
    1. Import JDBC package - import java.sql.*;
    2. Load and register the driver - Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");
    3. Establish connection - Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/college", "root", "password");
    4. Create statement - Statement stmt = con.createStatement();
    5. Execute queries - ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM student");
    6. Process result - while (rs.next()) {
                        System.out.println(rs.getInt(1) + " " + 
                        rs.getString(2));
                        }
    7. Close connection - con.close();

-Statement is use to executesimple sql queries(static)
-Preparedstatement used to execute parametarized sql queries(dynamic)
-Statement suitable for fixed sql queries
-Preparedstatement suitable for queries with variables
